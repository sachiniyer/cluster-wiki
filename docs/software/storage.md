# Storage

## Overview

I don't do anything to crazy here. The most important thing is being able to do good backups to the cluster.

## Rook Ceph

Rook is tough. I am not sure if it is the right choice. If I were to do this again I might choose something easier to back up like longhorn. I am still working on a good backup solution, and eventually want to take snapshots of my volumes to S3.
