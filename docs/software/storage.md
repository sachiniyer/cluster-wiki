# Storage

I don't do anything to crazy here. The most important thing is being able to do good backups to the cluster.

## Rook Ceph

I read quite a bit on ceph when I was interesting in storage managers, and quickly fell in love. I also really love rook-toolbox and overall I think that rook is just an excellent storage manager.

## Why not longhorn

I didn't choose the rancher suggested longhorn, because ceph is a bit more resilient. I also want in the future to get more into the weeds with my storage manager configuration and longhorn does not allow me to do that effectively.
